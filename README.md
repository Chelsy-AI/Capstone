## 🔌 API Integration

The application integrates with multiple free APIs:

- **OpenWeatherMap API** - Current weather data and weather icons
- **Open-Meteo API** - Primary weather data source
- **Open-Meteo Geocoding** - City name to coordinates conversion
- **Open-Meteo Archive** - Historical weather data
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** - Backup geocoding for map features
- **Sunrise-Sunset API** - Astronomical data for sun and moon phases

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application saves preferences automatically, including:
- Language selection
- Theme preferences (light/dark)
- Temperature unit preferences
- Historical weather data

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Modular Design
- Feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Each feature is self-contained and independently testable
- Plugin-style architecture allows easy addition of new features

### Data Management
