def test_get_tomorrows_prediction():
    """
    This test verifies that our get_tomorrows_prediction function works correctly.
    
    This function appears to predict tomorrow's weather using some kind of algorithm
    or machine learning model. We're testing that it returns the right type and
    structure of data, even though we can't easily test if the prediction is accurate.
    
    What we're testing:
    1. The function returns a tuple (a container with multiple values)
    2. The tuple contains exactly 3 items in the expected order
    3. Each item is the correct data type for its purpose
    """
    
    # Call our prediction function with a real city name
    # This likely uses historical data and/or current conditions to make a prediction
    result = get_tomorrows_prediction("New York")
    
    # Test 1: Check that we get back a tuple
    # A tuple is an ordered collection of items, perfect for returning multiple related values
    assert isinstance(result, tuple), "Function should return a tuple containing prediction data"
    
    # Test 2: Check that the first item is a float (predicted temperature)
    # Temperatures are typically decimal numbers, so float is the appropriate type
    assert isinstance(result[0], float), "First item should be predicted temperature as a float"
    
    # Test 3: Check that the second item is a string (confidence description)
    # This is likely a human-readable description of how confident the prediction is
    assert isinstance(result[1], str), "Second item should be confidence description as a string"
    
    # Test 4: Check that the third item is an integer (certainty scale)
    # This is probably a numerical confidence score, like a percentage or scale rating
    assert isinstance(result[2], int), "Third item should be certainty scale as an integer"
    
    # What this test accomplishes:
    # 1. Ensures the function doesn't crash when called
    # 2. Verifies the return format matches what other parts of our app expect
    # 3. Catches type errors that could cause problems later
    # 4. Documents the expected structure of the prediction data
    
    # What this test doesn't do:
    # - It doesn't verify the accuracy of the prediction (that's nearly impossible to test)
    # - It doesn't check if the confidence values make sense
    # - It doesn't test edge cases like invalid city names
    # - These could be added as additional tests
    
    # Why we test data types instead of specific values:
    # - Weather predictions change constantly based on current conditions
    # - We can't predict what the exact temperature will be
    # - But we can ensure the function always returns data in the right format
    # - This prevents type errors when other parts of the app use this data
