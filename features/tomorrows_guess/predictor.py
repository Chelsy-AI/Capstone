"""
Tomorrow's Weather Prediction Module
====================================

This module predicts tomorrow's weather based on recent historical patterns.
It's like having a simple weather forecaster that looks at the past few days
and makes an educated guess about what tomorrow might be like.

How it works:
1. Gets the last 7 days of weather data for a city
2. Analyzes recent temperature trends
3. Uses a simple averaging algorithm to predict tomorrow's temperature
4. Calculates confidence based on data quality and consistency
5. Returns prediction with accuracy estimates

The prediction algorithm:
- Uses the average of the last 3 days' temperatures
- Considers data quality (more data = higher confidence)
- Provides realistic accuracy estimates
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully

Think of this as a "smart average" that looks at recent weather patterns
to guess what tomorrow might bring!
