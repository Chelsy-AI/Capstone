Main Entry Point for Weather Dashboard
======================================

This is the starting point for the weather application.
It handles:
- Checking if required libraries are installed
- Creating necessary folders
- Starting the main weather app
- Showing helpful error messages if something goes wrong

Think of this as the "power button" for your weather app!
