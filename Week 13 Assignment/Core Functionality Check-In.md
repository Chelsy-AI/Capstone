I implemented the API calls by using the **OpenWeather API** to fetch today's temperature and the **Open-Meteo API** to retrieve additional data like humidity, wind, pressure, and 7-day weather history. I structured the API logic into separate, reusable Python functions that convert city names into coordinates, request the relevant data, and return it in a consistent format for display in the GUI. One challenge was aligning the data formats and units between the two APIs while ensuring smooth integration into the interface.

Next steps include adding multilingual support, weather-based background effects, and health-related suggestions based on current conditions.
